            <br>
            <p>I primarily utilize <span>Python</span> for my work. <br>
                I like using <span>Python</span> to build user interfaces (UI) and <br>
                logic for games and other challenging tasks. <br>
                I'm actively honing my <span>Flask</span> web programming abilities. <br>
                Additionally, I am enjoying using <span>HTML and CSS</span> to develop static websites. <br>
                <span>JS</span> is something I'm eager to master in the future. <br>
                Despite the fact that it's a little challenging.

            <h1>How it all started!</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I have been coding since I was 12, <span>Python</span> was my introduction <br>
                to the surreal world of computer language with its infinite possibilities. <br>
                Like those geeky kids, I've always been interested in <br>
                computers and other technology. So, one day, <br>
                I thought of digging a little deeper and got my hands on <span>Python</span>. <br>
                it's really easy to learn the basics and build a nice portfolio in <span>Python</span>. <br>
                Then I thought of learning <span>HTML and CSS</span>, and in my opinion, <br>
                they are the easiest languages. Although it's really hard <br>
                to debug <span>HTML</span> because there is no context for the error, in my <br>
                journey, I have built a few projects, <br>
                which you can check out on my <a class="git" href="https://github.com/aadit-garg">GitHub</a>

                Hey I have a <a href = "https://nimish.github.io/cuddly-diaries/"> Blog site </a><br>
