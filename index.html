                It can also be taken as a mental experiment that will writing blogs help me

            Hello!
            So where should I even start, today was fun, really fun. Today I broke many rules. Underage driving, riding
            without helmet, even tripling. It was fun though, when you do such stuff with friends. went on a really long
            walk with them too I geuss it was 6km or something. My Hindi exam also went kinda okayish yesterday. I am
            hoping for 90%, most of my random guesses were correct so it really boosted my percentage by around 5-6% I
            guess. But tommorow is English Exam and I am really scared for it, not because parents or anything, but my
            teacher. She have some unreal expectations from me, why so much trust over me, she said I can easily score
            98% this time, and as far as I know that's too much to ask for. My grammar is good enough that its not going
            to disappoint me my literature good too, but I cram things, I love to answer by theoretical approches I can
            write with complete Independece in such questions, but what I am scared about is the difficulty of exam, and
            that teacher never gives full score in writing and lit portion unless your answers are exceptionaly great,
            which is nearly impossible within a 3 hour time span, but lets see. <br><br>
            I am sure this writing stuff is really helping, slowly but surely. but still don't know why I get so many
            mood swings, it can be bipolar don't know though. I guess I need to control over many stuff, like
            procastinating, anger, and many more emotions. I guess it all happens because I feel lonely most of the
            times I dont know why. In my family every like every single cousin of mine have a sibling but, you geussed
            it right, not me. I always wanted a sibling, but never had one. even al the friends, classmates I have met
            so far have a sibling. I always feels a little zoned out and tbh envious, seeing them have a peculiar,
            intimate connection. I never felt that. They alway had someone to hold their backs. I never had anyone, not
            even a elder mentor. And how can we forget those silly fights. The stuff you can't tell to even your parents
            you can tell that to themüòê. Ya but fine, everything I get I never need to share itüòå.

            Namaste!<br>
            Day-6, So, tommorow finnaly my Hindi exam, so this is going to be a concise one.
            I am a little bit confident about my grammar and writing portion I didn't did any literature though. Becase
            the exam is going to theoretical based and I can write good theories. I am hoping for around 90% in Hindi
            well, it's just my expectation. What else can I talk about. Next exam is of English, I guess I can do well
            in it though. The math story I will write tommorow,it's intresting.
            <br><br>
            I don't know why people don't like talking with me I guess I am boring or Introvert but the first one makes
            sense, or I guess I am weird, when I get a little friendly I ask too personal questions, and I guess thats
            why the ignore me instead of telling me <em>(or I can be exaggerating they just dont like me or really busy
                to listen to my guff)</em>. I can't do anything thoughüòê. Well, it happens with me very often. I am not
            even on any of the social media. Don't know why though. I guess thisk experiment will help me get all my
            answers. or it is just another mistake, no one knows.

        <p>
            Joh-eun achim!<br>
            Day-5, lets see I did my Hindi grammar and somewhat literature only the writing portion is left.
            <br> I wrote a poem too.<br><br>
            <em class="title">I</em>
            <br><br>
            <em>I am not what I was,
                <br><br>
                I am what I am,
                <br><br>
                I hope to be a better I,
                <br><br>
                And believe me,
                <br><br>
                I will be.</em><br><br>

            I know it's a bit clich√© and cheesy, but it works.I don't why I am not worried for exam though,
            I never wanted to study Hindi, I was never good in it. I love English, Maths, Science, History
            and Computer Sc. .The Maths story I will tell tomorrow, but I am great in English "atleast my teach says
            that", like she said I am a man with great ideas and write theoretical answers better than the one with 100%
            marks (No braggin'), although I dont think soüòÖ.I don't write much though but I have a few poems and I am
            little
            tired now, not sure that can write more. So, it's it for now. It's a bit short though (Like someone reads it
            "I dont think so").

            Konnichiwa!<br>
            Day-4 So I again had a study duo today and man that boy is overachiever in extracurriculars,
            he just won gold medal in national championship for shooting under 17 and will be competing
            for freaking Olympics Jeez, like how, and still a nice person. that there is something I can't
            think of, I used to do fencing and was really good in it like i nailed foil in it the most difficult
            one, <em>(there are three weapons in fencing "Foil", "√âp√©e" & "Sabre";Even the ruels change too)</em>,
            as you can only hit torso, with a wobbly blade, and was fine in other two. I was best in footwork in the
            whole group, I was even teaching new students, and not just that the teacher was so humble, friendly,
            even
            helped with workout and told how to fix some common joint dislocations, but I left it about 2 years
            backüòê.
            I don't know why though but it was free.To go to the practice <em>(which was in school)</em> I actually
            bunked the first and last timeüòÖ. Good old times orth remembering, he gave us punishment like 20 min
            fencing
            walk under direct sun with all gear on "I am so sure we alway loose 0.5 kg weight after practice", it
            was
            the first time when I really felt dedication, so there's this lunge move in there is a jump variation
            where
            have to long-jump with high velocity and dash and aim for torso, it was so hard, the teach told us that
            move
            for like 100 times but he wasn't frustrated and that time it was dedication pushing us. It took 30 hours
            of
            practice to learn it and 20 hrs more to nail it, but we got itüòÄ.
            <br>
            I am tired and can't think of anything else so no 2nd para.

        <p>
            Hola!<br>
            Day-3 it's hat-trick noice. So, lets see, today, I had group study or more like study duo
            it was nice, more like competion, what else ? Hmm! today I was not procastinating I was, I guess,
            just more occupied by contemplation and stuff like really deep one about like. I noticed in my english
            book
            most of the poems are there to tell how a bad a man is. Like in the poem <em>"For Anne Gregory"</em>
            captures the idea that men can't actually love women from heart, inetrnally or purely <em>"without any
                intention"</em>, they are hypnotised
            by their beauty or any of the physical characteristic, "like every man is flattered by Anne's honey
            locks(ramparts) in poem"
            it also conveys that he would stop loving her if she got rid of those lock. I am not the person of
            choise to
            counter this but as per my grasp it's not true well surely beauty or physique is one of the reasons but
            not
            the only reason even beatuy is just relative. Surely, what I like, someone will not like it. And saying
            men
            are heartless lust machines isn't right. But, maybe a BIG BUT the poem is trying to convey some higher
            level
            meaning which my mind can't currently absorb than I can be wrong, also I don't know enough of whatever
            this
            is.
            <br><br>
            Well, I guess just leave it, let's talk about grammar. I alway thought plural of person is people, but
            no
            its not true it can be persons too, infact in official documents the use persons as persons reffers to a
            group of people but each person distinctively and not as one body. Also peoples is also a legit word,
            whatt?
            Similarly, It reffers to different group of people but each group distinctively, for eg. <em>"Peoples of
                different races."</em> instead of <em>"People of different races."</em>
            Thats actually a bit strange.

        <p>
            Bonjour!<br>
            Day-2 hmm! surprising, made it so far. Well I guess it's the same time today 1:30 am
            and I am banging some nice music. But, today there is something nice I lost 1.2kg
            of weight ooo!üéâüéâ in around 3 weeks I dont know how's it's possible, ya, I changed
            my diet but believe me the change was abysmal, I didn't exercised more or anything,
            cycling maybe about 2-3km not much but yaa more or less it's fine (as long as it's not life threatning
            or
            somethingüòÖ). My BMI(Body Mass Index) is normalish 20 something.
            <br><br>
            Nothing much happend <em>[`Currently the author is going through the boring repetitive stage of
                life,though it will perish slowly but surely`]</em> but lets think of something else.
            <br>
            I have toooo much rant but can't say it all in one day.
            Oh! speaking of units, our books are worst at it. Like sometimes they use KM then
            at other times it is Miles or Feets, sometimes Kelvin other times it's ¬∞Celcius,
            not even that sometimes they write M/S¬≤ other times it becomes MS‚Åª¬≤, I know it doesn't
            matter but I guess they can't choose a side, either British or American(It's tough I know)
            well but can't they atleast follow the same allover.
            <br>
            Also, Currently my social interaction is underoot(-1); yes, imaginary (those who didn't got it root(-1)
            =
            [i]maginary) my best friend is busy with their college my last chat was if not months then weeks ago
            (that too unread). I dont know why I always end with gloom.

            Hi! <br>
            So it's day-1 nothing intresting is going on other than I am writing this blog at <br>
            1:30 am üòÇ it's 10 Jan (11 Jan actually) and my pre-boards start from 16 man I am not confident enough
            I am planning to give next 5 days purely to revising first exam is of Hindi, the one I am worst in.
            <br><br>
            Ya but I remember something, few weeks back I had my ASL (Assessment of Speaking and Listening) I was
            tense
            so in ASL two students argue on different topics and interrogate each other.
            When me and my partner took the seat I accidentally hit my teacher, it was clearly not my intention,
            the teacher got furious but she thought the child sitting next to me did it.
            she scolded him so bad as apparently he didn't even apologized I was sitting there watching all her
            fury bursting over him. I was feeling so guilty but my scare didn't let me say a thing.
            She is the teacher I have met so far but it is one of the guilt which floods my mind before I sleep
            (yes, there are a few more), I think I will apologize the next day but I guess I don't have the guts all
            though that teacher is a really good friend of mine, I look at her as a mentor. Even, she is the reason
            I
            am writing this today, she gave me the advice to write diary to express my feellings and wither away my
            anxiety.
            I thought of taking it a step further and write public diaries(believe me it's hard). So I guess I will
            never apologize her and him and regret my decision. üòê
            <br><br>
            Inference : Never! ever! lie. being silent is also considered as a filthy lie and will make you regret
            and feel guilty only. Better speak the truth no matter the acute consequences.
