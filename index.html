            <h1>How it all started!</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I have been coding since I was 12, <span>Python</span> was my introduction <br>
                to the surreal world of computer language with its infinite possibilities. <br>
                Like those geeky kids, I've always been interested in <br>
                computers and other technology. So, one day, <br>
                I thought of digging a little deeper and got my hands on <span>Python</span>. <br>
                it's really easy to learn the basics and build a nice portfolio in <span>Python</span>. <br>
                Then I thought of learning <span>HTML and CSS,</span> and in my opinion, <br>
                they are the easiest languages. Although it's really hard <br>
                to debug <span>HTML</span> because there is no context for the error, in my <br>
                journey, I have built a few projects, <br>
                which you can check out on my <a class="name git" href="https://github.com/aadit-garg">GitHub</a>
                profile. <br>
                So that's about it.<br>
                I would love to meet new people and help the community.
